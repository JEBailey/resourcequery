# Resource Stream Support

* Resource Stream 
* Fluent interface for creation of a Predicate<Resource> for use with Collections and Streams
* Predefined predicates for Resources and Properties
* Filter language for creation of a Predciate<Resource> for use with Collections and Streams

Example of a stream.

```java
ResourceStream
	.from(resource)
	.stream(
		where(property("jcr:primaryType").is("cq:Page")))
   .filter(
      aChildResource("jcr:content")
          .has(property("sling:resourceType")
		    .isNot("sas/components/page/folder")));
```

same results using the filter script

```java
ResourceStream
    .from(resource)
    .stream("[jcr:primaryType] == 'cq:Page'")
    .filter("[jcr:content/sling:resourceType] != 'apps/components/page/folder'");
```

### Operators

| Name       | Comparison Type | Description                                |
| ---------  | --------------- | --------------------------------           |
| and        | NA              | Logical AND                                |
| &&         | NA              | Logical AND                                |
| or         | NA              | Logical OR                                 |
|&#124;&#124;| NA              | Logical OR                                 |
| ==         | String          | Equal operator for Strings                 |
| <          | Number         | Less than operator for Numbers             |
| <=         | Number         | Less than or equal operator for Numbers    |
| >          | Number         | Greater than operator for Numbers          |
| >=         | Number         | Greater than or equal operator for Numbers |
| !=         | String          | Is not equal to for Strings                |
| less than  | Number         | less than operator for Numbers             |
| greater than| Number        | greater than operator for Numbers          |
| is          | String         | Equal operator for Strings                 |
| is not      | String         | Is not equal operator for Strings          |
| like        | String - Regex  | Regex match against String                |
| like not    | String - Regex  | Regex match against String                |
| not like    | String - Regex  | Same as 'like not'               |
| contains         | String[] &#124; String[] | String[] contains all of items |
| contains not     | String[] | String[] does not contain all of the items |
| contains any     | String[] | String[] contains at least one of items |
| contains not any | String[] | String[] does not contain any of the items |
### Logical Operators
The 'and' and 'or' operators are logical operators that string together conditions. 'And' operators take precedence. 'Or' operators evaluate from left to right


### Values

Values for comparison are obtained through multiple methods

| Method       | Description                               |
| ----------   | ----------------------------------------  |
| Literal      | Single(') or double (") quoted text in the query will be interpreted as a String. Boolean values of *true* and *false* will be translated to a String. |
| Property     | A String between square brackets '[',']'s will be interpreted as a property value and will be retrieved from the Resource using the get method |
| Function     | A string followed by parens containing an optional comma separated list of values. |

### Types
All types are converted to either a String or a Number. For direct equivalence the comparison is done as a String. For relational comparisons the object will be adapted to a number.

### Dates/Instants
Dates are a special, there are multiple ways to enter a date.

Inline, as part of the query, a date can be identified as a string that conforms to a standard ISO-8601 date time.

> '2013-08-08T16:32:59.000'
>
> '2013-08-08T16:32:59'
>
> '2013-08-08T16:32'

Are all valid date representations that are defaulting to the UTC timezone.

For a ISO8601 date with timezone offset use the date function.

> date('2013-08-08T16:32:59.000+02:00')

If you need a different date format then the date function can accommodate that

> date('2013-08-08','yyyy-MM-dd')

Or you could just add your own custom Function 

Dates are transitionally represented as a java.util.Instant which is then converted to a String in ISO-8601 format or as a Long number based on the type of comparison. The number representing the time in milliseconds since the EPOCH UTC region

### Functions

Functions provide the ability to add additional functionality to the Filter language. A Function is written in the format

> string '(' comma, separated, list() ')'

All functions MUST return either a String, a Number, or an Instant. Strings are assumed to be using the default UTF encoding.

OOTB Functions are:

| Name  | Arguments | Returns | Description                                                    |
| ----  | --------- | ------- | -----------------------------------                            |
| name  | none      | String  | Provides the name of the resource                              |
| date  | 0 - 2     | Instant | First argument is string representation of the date, second argument is a standard Java DateFormat representation of the value. No argument returns the current time. |
| path  | none		| String  | path of the tested resource        |
